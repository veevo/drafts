# Before the little children who return to the beyond

Effectively, no one is prepared to receive the news that the child has cancer, especially when it comes to a child. And nothing can prepare a father and a mother to see this child lose the battle. In Lancashire, England, the 5-year-old Charles Proctor boy "apologized" to his mother before dying in his arms. He had a rare type of cancer and disembodied in the lap of his mother, Amber Schofield.

In November 2018, Schofield, 24, held little Charles in his lap when he gave his last breath. In an emotional post on the page he created on Facebook to tell the boy's story and ask for financial help so he could perform a transplant in the United States, she reported that a few hours before he was disincarnated, the boy told her, "Mom, I'm sorry for this". [1]

It is difficult to imagine the extent of the anguish Amber Schofield passed. Only those who lived similar situations can describe. Imagine her mother's distress at hearing her son's "apology" for a situation he had no control over just to see her suffer. However, the dignity that Schofield experienced, without revolt and humility, demonstrated how prepared she was for the situation.

Gone is the body of Charles, not its essence, the immortal spirit, that inhabited the body. There are many people who experience analogous experience, but they revolt and blaspheme.

In the 19th century, Allan Kardec asked the spirits: "What is the usefulness of premature deaths?" And the Benefactors replied: "Most often they serve as an ordeal for parents." [2] However, some insist that it is a terrible tragedy to see a life so hopeful that it is prematurely reaped.

Let's pacify our consciences rather than be unhappy when it is God's intention to remove one of our children from this planet of trials and atonements. We conceive that many situations called unhappiness, according to hasty interpretations, cease with physical life and find their compensation in life beyond the grave.

There are cases of early disincarnations that are not part of the process of natural consequences of the choices of the delinquent past and constitute, yes, meritorious actions of missionary spirits who are reborn to live a few years in contact with the flesh in function of relevant spiritual tasks. About this, André Luiz wrote: "We know great souls who were reborn on Earth for a very short time, simply with the purpose of waking up dear hearts for the acquisition of moral values, recovering after the service carried out, the respective presentation that was customary for them. "[3]

Emmanuel considers that "no suffering on earth can be comparable to that of the heart that dwells on another chaste and beloved heart which the coffin transports to the great silence." , convincing: "Tell those who have already narrowed against the breast a little child transfigured into an angel of agony. [4]

However, before those who demand Life in Spirituality, the behavior of the spiritist is something different, or at least must be different with a prevalence of factors related to faith and emotion. Spiritists cry discreetly but strengthen themselves in prayer. In the certainty of Glorious Immortality, they repress the cry that slides on the suffering physiognomy, but seek in Esperanza one of the evangelical virtues, the balm for just saudade.

The sincere Spiritist never gives in to despair. "One does not yield to the appeals of revolt, because revolt is insubordination before the Will of the Father, which the spiritist learns to accept, paradoxically and strangely jubilant, inside, bent away to the weight of the most acute afflictions."[5]
